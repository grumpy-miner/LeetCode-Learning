# LeetCode-Learning
Repository for learning purposes with LeetCode solutions.

## Motivation
My journey with programming started while studying mathematics at Warsaw University of Technology. The first language I picked up was C++.

(Well, technically, it was Logo in primary school, but instead of studying, we usually played Counter Strike in class.)

After some time, I fell in love with Python because...

Now, after all these years, I decided go back to something more mature - a language that will not leave me with a lighter and gasoline, saying, "Have fun, kiddo!" and close it's eyes

My plan is to learn Rust and Golang to the extent that I can feel comfortable.

## Why LeetCode?
I could take on a project and start building it in any of these languages, but I felt that:

- I need to start with small, easy tasks first.
- Doing small exercises involving data structures is never a bad idea.
- I have fun doing it, and that is what matters.

## Plans
As I said, I plan to learn Rust and Golang to the extent that I feel comfortable enough to:
- Implement something without frequently looking up "how to iterate over an array" or "do I need to put a semicolon there."
- GO FAST AS F*CK BOOOOOI (Python is great, but it's hard to run fast like a hedgehog if you have no legs).
- Look at what I implemented after some time and see if I could do it better now.

And the most important plan besides learning is to have fun along the way.
